general:
- When building, make should take only the dependent code from lib/netwrk.
- Add signal handlers. SIGABRT, SIGKILL, etc to properly handle signals.
- Implement logger module.
- Argument check at the beginning of any critical function must assert(), if invalid.
- Implement a thread safe buffer data structure.
- Integrate command line parsing to read options. getopt().
- Use gethostbyname() instead of IP.
- Create heirarchical Makefiles.
- Set SYSROOT_DIR according to TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX.
- Write makefiles to build lib/netwrk/*.c as libnetwrk.so or libnetwrk.a.

ftp-cli:
- Add lock/unlock for ftp_data_buff.
- Show download progress. Eg: Percentage.
- Implement ring buffer for the internal recv buffer.

packet-sniffer:
- Integrated pcap support. -> Use libpcap.

ISSUES
- Careful: recv() on the same socket is being called simultaneously.
- FD_ZERO() issue for raspi/ARM platform.
